### Industry: 
Document Management

### Technologies Used
- **Java** (Backend)
- **Spring Boot** (Backend Framework)
- **React.js** (Frontend)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **Amazon S3** (Cloud Storage)
- **OAuth 2.0** (Authentication)
- **Jenkins** (CI/CD)
- **RESTful APIs** (Integration)

## Project Overview
The **Cloud-Based Document Management System (DMS)** is designed to streamline the process of document storage, retrieval, and collaboration, offering a secure and scalable platform that allows users to manage their documents from anywhere. Hosted entirely on the cloud, the system ensures data accessibility and security, making it ideal for teams and businesses requiring real-time collaboration.

### Key Features:
- **Document Storage and Retrieval**: Upload and store documents securely with advanced search capabilities for quick access.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share documents with team members, enabling real-time collaboration and feedback.
- **Version Control**: Track document revisions with complete version histories and the ability to restore previous versions.
- **Access Control**: Set permissions and access levels for different users to ensure document confidentiality and control over edits.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with third-party tools and services, enhancing workflow automation.

## Business Challenge
The client, a mid-sized company, faced inefficiencies in handling their growing document repository. Their existing system lacked real-time collaboration tools, version control, and strong security measures. Additionally, document retrieval was slow and disorganized, leading to productivity issues. Key challenges included:
- Difficulty in tracking and managing document versions.
- Lack of secure, role-based access control for confidential documents.
- Slow document retrieval, hindering workflow efficiency.
- No integration with existing tools, requiring manual processes.

## Solution Delivered
To address these issues, we developed a **Cloud-Based Document Management System** using a combination of modern technologies such as **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **React.js** for an efficient and user-friendly solution. The system was deployed on **AWS S3** for secure document storage, integrated with **OAuth 2.0** for authentication, and used **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment.

## Implementation Highlights
- **Backend Development**: Built scalable and efficient **RESTful APIs** using **Java** and **Spring Boot** to manage document operations, including upload, retrieval, sharing, and version control.
- **Database Design**: Designed and optimized the **MySQL** schema to store and retrieve document metadata efficiently, ensuring quick searches.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Integrated **Amazon S3** for secure, scalable document storage and retrieval.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented **OAuth 2.0** for secure user authentication and fine-grained access control to ensure only authorized users can access specific documents.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Established a continuous integration and deployment pipeline using **Jenkins**, ensuring seamless updates and scaling as user demands grow.

## Outcomes
The new **Cloud-Based Document Management System** delivered significant improvements in document handling, security, and team collaboration. Key results included:
- **Improved Document Management**: Streamlined document organization, resulting in faster document retrieval and better version control.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Provided real-time collaboration tools that improved team productivity and efficiency.
- **Scalability & Security**: Delivered a secure and scalable platform that could grow with the business while maintaining strong data protection.
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on the intuitive UI and seamless integration with their existing workflow tools.
- **Business Growth**: Helped the client gain a competitive edge by offering a feature-rich document management system that meets modern business needs.

## My Contribution
As part of the project, I contributed to the following areas:
- **Backend Development**: Developed scalable and secure **RESTful APIs** using **Spring Boot** for handling document operations such as upload, retrieval, sharing, and version control.
- **Database Design**: Optimized the **MySQL** database schema to store document metadata efficiently and ensure fast data retrieval.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Integrated **Amazon S3** for secure and scalable document storage.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented **OAuth 2.0** for secure and role-based user authentication and access control.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensured the backend was optimized for high performance, handling large-scale document operations and concurrent users effectively.

The system successfully transformed the clientâ€™s document management processes, providing an efficient, secure, and scalable solution for their growing needs.
